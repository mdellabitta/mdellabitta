# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently hacking on the Digital Public Library of America, a national non-profit that empowers people to learn, grow, and contribute to a diverse and better-functioning society by maximizing access to our shared history, culture, and knowledge.

A big chunk of my work involves harveting data from a variety of institutions across the country, transforming it into a standardized schema, enriching it, and making it available in a [public API](https://pro.dp.la/developers/api-codex) and [website](https://dp.la). I'm also responsible for running DPLA's AWS account, performing all Devops and SRE duties, and other engineering tasks as they arise.

A major current project of ours involves harvesting permissively-licensed and public domain media files and uploading them to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), where DPLA is now the [largest single contributor](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Media_contributed_by_the_Digital_Public_Library_of_America).

I'm productive in a variety of programming languages, including Python, Scala, Java, Javascript, Typescript, and Ruby, and I'm working on more.
